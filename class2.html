            <p><strong>Thoughts so far:</strong>  am enjoying this class and frankly get excited to do the coursework. So far, we have been making websites using HTML with the code sourced from prompts from ChatGPT and other AI tools. It is very satisfying being able to see things I write turn into content on a webpage that I have a hand in designing and am looking forward to seeing what else we make.</p>
