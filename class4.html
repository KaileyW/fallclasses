            <p>This course aims to survey of the communication discipline across areas of specialization from interpersonal to mediated and mass communication, including history and fundamental concepts, theories, and contexts. It places emphasis on ethical human behavior and message analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Thoughts so far:</strong> This class is going well so far. We have been discussing Greek philosophers and sophists which has been interesting to learn about. It’s more of a lecture and test type of class which I don’t prefer, however.</p>
