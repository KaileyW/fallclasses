            <h2>Visual News Reporting</h2>
            <p>This course covers news reporting through photography, videography, online outlets, and data visualization as well as the concepts of visual storytelling. Also explored are design and production tools and techniques for visual news and feature stories.</p>
            <p><strong>Professor:</strong> Dr. Syrenthia J. Robinson</p>
            <p>Dr. Robinson is a Virginia Tech Senior Instructor in the School of Communication. Her research focuses are in Multimedia Journalism, Video Recording and Editing, Web Design and Editing, and Production Management. Prior to teaching, Dr. Robinson worked in the television industry for 16 years in broadcast and cable television as a producer, and then in cable television where she worked as a manager of Original Programming, Production, and Administration. She received her education from the University of Southern Mississippi (Hattiesburg) and the University of Tennessee (Knoxville). Dr. Robinson loves dogs and is a basketball mom.</p>
            <p><strong>Thoughts so far:</strong> his class has been enjoyable and informative thus far. Currently, we are learning about photography which I find particularly fun. We are also learning how to become familiar with Adobe products like Lightroom and other editing software. This is a project-based class with a lot of room for creativity as well.</p>
