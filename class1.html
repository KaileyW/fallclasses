            <h2>Intercultural Issues in Professional Writing</h2>
            <p>This course focuses on intercultural issues in the workplace. Thus, it explores ways in which notions about culture and identity shape professional interactions. It goes over theories of culture, context, identity, language, technology, social equity, and justice as relevant to professional and technical writing. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of the issues involved in writing and designing documents for diverse audiences and how intercultural communication can support creating an equitable workplace.</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts so Far:</strong> This course is going well thus far. It includes more discussions and projects than tests which is something I prefer. I haven’t learned very much as of yet, but it is a class I certainly don’t mind taking as it is fairly interesting.</p>
            <p><strong>Professor:</strong> Sweta Baniya</p>
            <p>Dr. Sweta Baniya is an assistant professor of rhetoric and professional and technical writing from Nepal. She received her Doctorate degree in Rhetoric and Composition from the Department of English at Purdue University. Her research centers around the ever-evolving and challenging global issue of natural and manmade disasters, such as earthquakes or climate change. She has around 35 publications (single-authored and collaborative) including her book she published earlier this year titled “Transnational Assemblages: Social Justice and Crisis Communication during Disaster.” Dr. Baniya enjoys crocheting, yoga, and eating snacks. She also adopted a dog named Cheeto earlier this summer.</p>
