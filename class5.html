            <p><strong>Thoughts so far:</strong> I have liked this class so far and enjoy reading the textbook as it outlines different things you need to know as someone writing for media outlets. For the first major assignment, I got to interview one of the reporters at WDBJ7, the Roanoke news station, and learn more about her and the profession she is in. There are some grammar tests we will have occasionally, but I donâ€™t mind them as I know I need to refresh my knowledge of proper grammar and punctuation usage.</p>
